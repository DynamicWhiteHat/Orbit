# Orbit
## An ESP32-powered mini drone with autonomous following capability

## Features:
- ESP32 S3 Wroom 1u SoM
- 4x 0716 coreless motors
- MPU6050 for gyro
- QMC5883 compass
- MS5611 pressure sensor for altitude hold
- 3x SK6812 for signal LEDs
- Battery charging via USB-C
- 2x frame mounted DWM1000 for position tracking
- 1x small form factor DWM1000 board "beacon"

## Why I designed this project:

I wanted to design a drone for HackClub's Blueprint program, but not just any regular drone. I wanted to add a feature that would make it stand out, something that would make it unique. So, I decided to give it the ability to autonomously follow you to an accurate degree. After doing some research, I found the DWM1000 modules and decided to design this project. I designed and redesigned the PCBs and CAD for this project many times, with each iteration improving upon the last. This project also gave me the ability to test and improve my PCB and CAD design skills. I understood a lot more about schematic connections while working on this project and learned to route much cleaner traces, even on a compact board.
